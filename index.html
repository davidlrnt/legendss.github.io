		<h2 class="posttitle">1st entry - terminal & github</h2>
		<p>The first days of the Web Development program have been focused into discovering the terminal, getting comfortable using command line and git revision control system.</p>
		<p>
		Implementations on this blog:
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>I created the blog inside a github repository which can be accessed through github pages. </li>
		<li>Iâ€™ve used the terminal to clone the blog repository into my local system.</li>
		<li>I've created a new branch from master to edit the files.</li>
		<li>The edited files where then added and committed.</li>
		<li>I merged the edited branch with my local master branch</li>
		<li>Then I pushed the local master branch to my remote location.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="posttitle">The blog challenge!</h2>
		<p> I have to admit, I'm a horrible writer. I've had many failed blog attempts in the past. I don't want this blog to be something that I half-ass, like my previous blogs. English is not even my first language, for god sake's. </p> 
		<p>So, I needed to comeup with something entirely different than I have ever done. So, instead of staring at my screen for hours trying to think of something to write, I decided to create my own blogging platform (crazy I know). </p><p> Though, I do realize that it would be extra work to create a blog platform from scratch, I thought it would be the best way to keep track of my journey. The more advanced the platform became, the more knowledge I aquired. Thus, the blog itself would be a representation of my learning progress and my blog posts would be a record of how far I came. </p><p> Whenever I make a new entry, I would describe every new thing that I have learned, and then I would describe the changes I would make to the blog platform based on my new skills. That way, my audience can see the advancment of my blog through my writing as well as the U.I. of the blog itself.</p><p> Obviously, I don't expect to be the next Tumblr, but just a visual result of my progress.
